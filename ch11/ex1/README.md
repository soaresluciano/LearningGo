# Exercise 1

## Question
Go to https://www.ohchr.org/en/human-rights/universal-declaration/translations/english and copy the text of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into a text file called english_rights.txt. Click the "Other Languages" link and copy the text of the document in a few additional languages into files named LANGUAGE_rights.txt. Create a program that embeds these files into package-level variables. Your program should take in one command-line parameter, the name of a language. It should then print out the UDHR in that language.
