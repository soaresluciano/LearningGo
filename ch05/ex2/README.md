# Exercise 2

## Question
Write a function called `fileLen` that has an input parameter of type `string` and returns an `int` and an `error`. 
The function takes in a file name and returns the number of bytes in the file. If there is an error reading the file, 
return the error. Use `defer` to make sure the file is closed properly.
