# Exercise 2

## Question
Write two functions. The `UpdateSlice` function takes in a `[]string` and a `string`. It sets the last position in the passed-in slice to the passed-in `string`. Print the slice after making the change. The `GrowSlice` function also takes in a `[]string` and a `string`. It appends the `string` onto the slice. Print the slice after making the change. Call these functions from `main`. Print out the slice before each function is called and after each function is called.
